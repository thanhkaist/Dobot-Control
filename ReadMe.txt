The Demo operation process is as follows:


1. Running DobotControl.py under python.


2. Under normal conditions you can see that you have opened the camera and placed the checkerboard below the camera, and you can see it clearly. (if you can't turn on the camera, see the python section of the Demo description document).


3. The keyboard enters the calibration mode according to the "c" key. According to the dialog prompt, the Dobot is moved to the corresponding red, green and blue points by Dobot's teaching key.


4. The keyboard enters the tracking mode according to the "s" key. At this time, a DobotRun image is popped up, and any position of the image is double clicking. The manipulator will move to this position.


5. The keyboard is based on the "q" key to exit the program.
